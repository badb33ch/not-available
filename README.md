Basically a "default edit" resource pack for Minecraft.

This resource pack contains newly-since-1.14 default textures from Mojang and were backported to work with Minecraft version 1.7 and above. Some textures are edited by me to improve the PvP experience (that's why it's a default edit, duh). The resource pack is WIP and will be updated with time.
# Why did you create a GitHub repo just to maintain a resource pack?
Well, excuse me because this idea popped into my head. And I wanted to try doing it so here it is. ðŸ˜­

Normally every other people would just edit their resource pack, store it on their computer then upload it to a cloud service. But, the fact with GitHub repos is that they both aren't limited to code and not storage-limited. So that's a benefit and the main reason why I wanted to maintain my resource pack with a GitHub repository.
# License
While having a few textures that are edited by me, this resource pack contains Mojang's original textures and other's textures so I am not able to license my repository. However, this is still my piece of work.
