Basically a Minecraft default edit resource pack.
This resource pack contains newly-since-1.14 default textures from Mojang and were backported to work with Minecraft version 1.7 and above. Some textures are edited by me to improve the PvP experience (that's why it's a default edit, duh). The resource pack is WIP and will be updated with time.
