### Yes, the pack name is *not available*.
Basically a "default edit" resource pack for Minecraft. 

This resource pack contains newly-since-1.14 default textures from Mojang and were backported to work with Minecraft version 1.8+. It is somewhat similar to the TheLegend27 pack but with a few touches from me. The resource pack is WIP and will be updated with time.

*Textures backported from snapshot 22w46a*
## As of now, all of the texture files haven't been uploaded onto GitHub yet so please give me some time to finalize everything.
# Download
(1.8) Click the green Code button on the top right and then click Download ZIP (or just simply click [here](https://github.com/th3n4n/not-available/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)). Once you've finished downloading, unzip the file to your `.minecraft/resourcepack` folder. 

(1.9+) Do the same steps for 1.8, then download the overlay pack that contains textures for 1.9+ [here](https://github.com/th3n4n/not-available/archive/refs/heads/1.9+-overlay.zip). Once downloaded, unzip the file to your `.minecraft/resourcepack` folder. Enter the game then apply the main pack first then the overlay pack.
# Why did you create a GitHub repo just to maintain a Minecraft resource pack?
Well, excuse me because this idea popped into my head. And here it is. ðŸ˜­

Normally every other people would just edit their resource pack, store it on their computer then upload it to a cloud service. But, the fact about GitHub repos is that they both aren't limited to only code and not storage-limited. So that's a benefit and the main reason why I wanted to maintain my resource pack with a GitHub repository. Plus, you can see what changes I did to the pack/repository through commit history as well.
